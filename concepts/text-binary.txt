Differences between binary mode and text mode have been listed below:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1)
 - Open file in text mode when dealing with formatted text.
 - Open file in binary mode to access or modify structured records present inside it.

2)
 - Text mode has end of file (EOF) and newline (carriage return-linefeed combination) characters in the file buffer
 - Binary mode does not have such characters.

3)
 - fgetc(), fputc(), fprintf(), fscanf() etc are the common functions used in text mode
 - fread(), fwrite() etc are the commonly used functions in binary mode.

4)
 - Numbers are stored as string of characters in text mode
 - Numbers are stored as present in memory (int, float etc.) in binary mode
