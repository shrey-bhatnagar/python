Method overloading is not supported in python. Only latest function is available for use.

def product(a, b): 
    p = a * b 
    print(p) 

def product(a, b, c): 
    p = a * b*c 
    print(p) 
  
# Uncommenting the below line shows an error     
# product(4, 5) 
  
# This line will call the second product method 
product(4, 5, 5)
