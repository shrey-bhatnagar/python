Class and Object:
 While the class is the blueprint, an instance is a copy of the class with actual values.


Encapsulation: < Information hiding or system complexity hiding >
 1) Encapsulation is a mechanism of binding the data member & member function into a single unit known as class.
 2) Encapsulation provides a way for abstraction.<restricting the access to some of the objectâ€™s components>

 eg: (class is kind of a container or capsule or a cell, which encapsulate the set of methods and attribute)


Abstraction: < Implementation hiding >
 1) Data abstraction is a mechanism to provide the essential features without describing the background details. Means provide the functions to access the hidden (private) data.


Data Hiding: < data security >
 1) Data hiding is a mechanism to hide the internal structure of an object from rest of the program

 eg: private variable - 


Polymorphism: < many form's>
Polymorphism means one thing in many form. Basically polymorphism is capability of one object to behave in multiple ways.

 1) Static polymorphism(compile time) : It is achieved using function overloading and operator overloading.
 2) Dynamic polymorphism(runtime time) : It is achieved using function overriding means using virtual function.

   a)inbuilt
   b)user defined function
   c)class methods (for call on object tupple)
   d)Method Overriding
   e)Function and objects (pass object in function)
